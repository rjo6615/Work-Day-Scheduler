# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

While learning web development it is important to understand and utalize javascript and API.
This project allowed me to display my skills in javascript through the creation of a work day scheduler where
a user can save events at a certain time to their computers local storage.

## Usage

To use this project, start by clicking where it reads "Add events here" under the time slot of your choice.
Type the event you wish to add and click the save button to the right. Any changes made will require you to click
the save button for it to be stored to local storage. The hour blocks will be color coated depending on where it is past (gray), present (red), or future (green).
